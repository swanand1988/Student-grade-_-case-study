# Student-grade-_-case-study
In this small project I implement a simple algorithmic model that predicts the score of an individual students at he end of the year. "G3" or the final grade will be our label (output) and the rest of the columns will be our features (inputs). First, I will explore the data to see if we can get a grasp of what is the story behind the data.

# Outline of Project
1. Extraction of data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data structure
4. Data visulization
5. Machine learning model
